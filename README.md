OVERVIEW:

This project involves designing and simulating a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog or MATLAB. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications due to their stability and linear phase response.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

Implement an FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB.
Simulate the filter’s response to verify its functionality.
Analyze the filter’s performance in terms of frequency response and stability.

DELIVERABLES:

✔ Verilog/MATLAB Code for FIR Filter
✔ Simulation Results Demonstrating Filter Operation
✔ Performance Analysis Report

INSTRUCTIONS:

Clone this repository.
Implement the FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB.
Simulate the design using appropriate tools (ModelSim, MATLAB Simulink, etc.).
Analyze and document the filter’s response.

OUTPUT:
